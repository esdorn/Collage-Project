For picture 2
I swap the quadrants then shrank it to a 1/4 of it original size and put four of 
them together to make the picture

For picture 3
I blended a negative with a grey scale with a weight of 3:1

For picture 4
I rotated the image 180 degrees

For picture 5
I diagonally mirrored the image across the diagonal recursively careful this uses lots of memory

For picture 6
I greyed out the background but not the monsters by checking if the red > than the green and the blue
if that's true it doesn't grayscale it out
